# Faculty Syllabus Notifications

Take a CSV of our missing syllabi VAULT report and send emails to faculty about which syllabi we expect from them. We skip notifying faculty for courses which do not require syllabi (e.g. Graduate Studio Practice) and work around problematic faculty values like "Staff" and "Standby".

## Steps

Note that this app needs to be run from a server with mail capabilities on CCA's network, so as to avoid getting flagged by Google as a potential phishing attempt.

- update the due date & other pieces of the email template in notify.py
- pull faculty usernames by running the included "faculty.sql" in the Portal database but updating the term to the current one, then saving the results as CSV (without header row)
- create a python dict of new usernames merged with known ones using `./process-un-csv.py usernames.csv > tmp; mv tmp usernames.py`
- in VAULT, run the Missing Syllabi by Semester report (`./app.py --open-report` opens it)
- Export the report to Excel, then save it as a CSV after trimming off the useless bit at the top (but not column headers) & date at the bottom
- sync the local data to the mail server (our dev website server) with sync.sh, then SSH into that server to send the mail
- finally, run `./app.py report.csv >> log.txt` to send out emails, where log.txt is a log file
    + the `--template` flag lets you specify an email template out of the available choices of "initial", "followup", "final", and "summer" e.g. `./app.py report.csv --template followup`
    + you can monitor the emails as they go out using `mail-log.sh` which just continually inspects your system's mail.log file

You can dry-run the app by setting a `DEBUG` environment variable to "true" and then running with the normal settings. Note that this can be a great way to detect missing usernames because those are output to stderr before the samples of emails that would be sent. This gives you a chance to manually add them to usernames.py.

## Other Notes

If you don't update usernames.py with missing faculty emails before sending out the first batch, you can look at the errors, fill in missing names, and then rerun the app later by filtering report.csv to just the courses of these "missing" instructors. If you do this, remember to delete out the co-instructors who already received an emailâ€”e.g. if we don't have an email for J R & the faculty column for a course is "J R, Herb Somebody" then delete "Herb Somebody" before rerunning the app.

You can also use "has_syllabus.py" to count the number of rows in a CSV of courses which have syllabi, the syntax is `python has_syllabus.py courses.csv`.

## Report Format

Report CSV should have the following columns with this exact header row

> "Semester","Department Code","Course Title","Instructor(s)","Section"

Some of the columns are not used but these are the ones typically contained in the VAULT report.
